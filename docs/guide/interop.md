# Interop

unthrown ships thin bridges to the three most common neighbours in the
errors-as-values space. Each is a separate, peer-dependency package with a small
`to*` / `from*` surface — nothing to learn beyond "which direction am I going."

| Package                                              | Peer dependency    | Bridges                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| [`@unthrown/effect`](/api/effect/)                   | `effect`           | `Exit`, `Either`, `Effect` |
| [`@unthrown/neverthrow`](/api/neverthrow/)           | `neverthrow`       | `Result`, `ResultAsync`    |
| [`@unthrown/boxed`](/api/boxed/)                     | `@bloodyowl/boxed` | `Result`, `Future<Result>` |
| [`@unthrown/standard-schema`](/api/standard-schema/) | _(types only)_     | any Standard Schema        |

## The one rule: does the neighbour have a defect channel?

unthrown has **three** channels — `Ok`, `Err`, and the out-of-band `Defect`. Most
libraries have only two. That single difference decides every signature.

- **Coming _in_** (`from*`), a two-channel result is only ever an `Ok` or an
  `Err` — the bridge **never** produces a `Defect`.
- **Going _out_** (`to*`) to a two-channel type, a `Defect` has nowhere to live.
  Rather than silently fold it into your domain error, the bridge **forces** you
  to triage it with a mandatory `onDefect: (cause) => E` — the same
  boundary-qualification rule unthrown enforces everywhere. There is no one-arg
  form.

```ts
import { ok } from "unthrown";
import { toNeverthrow } from "@unthrown/neverthrow";

// onDefect is required — the compiler will not let you drop a defect.
toNeverthrow(ok(1), (cause) => ({ _tag: "Bug", cause }));
```

## Effect — a genuine bijection

Effect is the exception: it _does_ have a defect channel (`Cause.die`), so
`Result ↔ Exit` round-trips losslessly.

```ts
import { ok, err } from "unthrown";
import { toExit, fromEffect } from "@unthrown/effect";
import { Effect } from "effect";

toExit(ok(1)); // Exit.succeed(1)
toExit(err("e")); // Exit.fail("e")  — a modeled Cause.fail
// a Defect would become Exit.die(cause)

// Run an Effect and collect its outcome; a die/interrupt becomes a Defect:
await fromEffect(Effect.succeed(1)).match({ ok, err, defect: String });
```

`toEffect` also accepts an `AsyncResult` (the `AsyncResult → Effect` direction),
and `toEither` — since `Either` has no defect channel — takes the same mandatory
`onDefect`.

## Async

Every package mirrors its sync pair for the asynchronous types:

- `@unthrown/effect` — `fromEffect` returns an `AsyncResult`; `toEffect` accepts
  one.
- `@unthrown/neverthrow` — `toNeverthrowAsync` / `fromNeverthrowAsync` bridge
  `AsyncResult ↔ ResultAsync`.
- `@unthrown/boxed` — `toBoxedFuture` / `fromBoxedFuture` bridge `AsyncResult ↔
Future<Result>`.

On the way in, an _unexpected_ rejection inside the neighbour's async type
becomes a `Defect` — never a silently-swallowed error.

## Standard Schema — validators as `Result`s

[`@unthrown/standard-schema`](/api/standard-schema/) is the odd one out: there's
no `to*` direction (you don't turn a `Result` back into a schema). It bridges
**any** [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) validator — Zod, Valibot,
ArkType — into a validator that returns a `Result`. The schema's validation
**issues become the modeled error `E`**, because a failed validation is an
anticipated outcome, not a defect.

```ts
import { fromSchema, fromSchemaAsync } from "@unthrown/standard-schema";
import { z } from "zod";

const parseUser = fromSchema(z.object({ id: z.string() }));

parseUser({ id: "u_1" }).unwrap(); // { id: "u_1" }
parseUser({ id: 1 }).unwrapErr(); // readonly StandardSchemaV1.Issue[]
```

- `fromSchema(schema)` → `(input) => Result<Output, Issues>` for a synchronous
  schema (it throws a `TypeError` if the schema is async — use the next one).
- `fromSchemaAsync(schema)` → `(input) => AsyncResult<Output, Issues>`, accepting
  sync **or** async schemas. A validator that _throws_ (rather than returning
  issues) becomes a `Defect`; the `AsyncResult` never rejects.

The only dependency is the tiny, types-only `@standard-schema/spec` — your
validator library provides the runtime.
